<h2>About CIS</h2>

CIS is an educational platform where students can easily browse courses from various other MOOC platforms. We centralize course browsing and on top of that provide a recommendation system that can help you decide what course you want to take up based on your past learning and what you intend to learn. CIS also features a fully fledged Course Enrollment system where Instructors can host their course on our platform and get students enrolled in the system. We also have a discussion forum where students can interact with other students and instructors in real-time. Forums are created based on populor demand by SuperAdmins. For the administration , CIS provides a fully functional administrative dashboard that provides insights into all database activities.
